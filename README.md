# Indeed-Web-Scraping
In this project I scraped top 100 data scientist jobs on Indeed of Orange County, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Chicago, Austin and DC. I obtained the frequencies of jobs from each job description that mention C, C++, Java, Javascript, Python, R, SQL, Hadoop, Hive, Pig, Spark, AWS and Tableau

I used this data to answer the following questions.

1.	What is the highest frequency language for each city?
2.	Is there any difference among those cities?

After answering these questions, I wrote a story detailing my findings in Medium. The full article can be found here.
